1) Rails generate controller products
2) Goto routes.tb
resources :products

3) add index action and index.html.erb view files


**************************************************
Feature enhancements :

After sign_in, the path needs to be where the user came from instead of going to the products page.
Problem: When adding a review without signing in, he is taken to the login page and after that he goes to the product page
